## ⚡ Fun Fact

Did you know that the world's first computer bug was an actual insect? In 1947, while working on the Harvard Mark II computer, Grace Hopper and her team found a moth stuck in one of the relay switches, causing a malfunction. They removed the moth and taped it to their logbook with the note "First actual case of bug being found." This incident led to the coining of the term "debugging" for fixing computer glitches.


Thanks for stopping by! Happy coding! 😄👨‍💻
